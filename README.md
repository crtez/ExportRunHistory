# ExportRunHistory
Export your entire Hades run history to JSON.

Note: Boons will appear as "ZeusBonusBounceTrait" or "SpeedDamageTrait" and so on. 
These may be confusing, so use the localizations file at "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Hades\Content\Game\Text\en\CodexText.en.sjson" or the equivalent for Steam in order to translate them to their "real" names.

For example, in the CodexText.en.sjson file, "ZeusBonusBounceTrait" corresponds to "Storm Lightning" and "SpeedDamageTrait" corresponds to "Rush Delivery".
